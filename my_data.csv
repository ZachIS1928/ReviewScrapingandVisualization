6,1,Poor Communication and a pattern of delays,"Unbelievably terrible service with Allegiant. They lie when they tell you anything on the plane! We had no weather for 3-4 hours but they blame weather for the delay. Since Covid, their service gets worse and worse."

12,1,Absolute nightmare,When I got to the airport there was no one at the luggage counter to grab my checked bags that I paid for. So I had to bring them all through security. By the time I got to the terminal two teenage girls wouldn’t let me on the flight claiming I was late when it was still…
13,5,Great Experience,"I had a great experience with Allegiant Airlines. All employees were very friendly and helpful. My nonstop flights did not experience any delays. Also, I didn't have to leave at the crack of dawn to get a great price. I will fly Allegiant Airlines from now on."

21,2,Sketchy scam at checkout,"Website changes seat prices by $30 at checkout after saying ""oops something odd happened"".

24,1,Avoid at all costs,I am so frustrated with Allegiant. They are the only airline to have you pre-pay for your pet but then will not refund you if your plans change. Yet you have to reserve your pet in advance.  I wanted to make sure there would be space for my dog over the Christmas holidays so I…

32,2,Ridiculously Inefficient and Exhausting ,"Allegiant check in is ridiculously inefficient.   Even having pre-boarded online, bag drop on outbound and return flights took over an hour.

40,1,Terrible experience. Poor planning. Poor flight attendants ,Crabby crew. Flight attendant showed up late so flight was delayed. Ice on the plane so they just sat in the sun for extra 30-40 minutes.  Wouldn’t let people move to empty rows.  Ended up leaving 40 minutes late. Terrible experience 
41,1,Good luck with that...,"Nobody was at the desk for a good while before they closed and no one could get a hold of them. I called their customer service number for help, freaking awful customer service with horrible attitude and didn't help at all. And yes, I missed my flight."

44,2,Worthy of a Hollywood comedy,"I'll give this a two-star because when a Hollywood producer turns my experience into a movie, and I become a millionaire, I can at least thank them for the inspiration. Or at least Air Disasters needs a tongue-in-cheek spinoff on bad experiences and make this their pilot.  I…"
45,1,It Sucked,These JERKS cancelled the flight at 3 am the day of the flight. Screwed up all our  plans and reservations. Won't be flying Allegiant again. My Flight was supposed to be to Port Charlotte Fl. where your resort is located. Won't be stopping by your new resort either. Hope it…
46,1,Sent SO to different airport. 13 HOUR MISFLIGHT,they managed to miss the landing and send my significant other to a location that is a 13 hour round trip distance. I can not believe how incompetent of an airline you are to do this to customers who have paid over $300 for the airfare.
47,1,Lost bag no reimbursement ,My first time ever flying this airline. It will be the last. The airline lost my bag and I had know immediate way of knowing where it was.

48,1,Lost a customer for life,Delayed 4 times from 10pm to 5am and then cancelled at 4:30am. That’s not how you treat people. The $200 voucher is worthless.

53,3,You get what you pay for and this was a bargain. ,"I was a little reluctant to fly a cut rate, no frills airline but was surprised at the economy of Allegiant compared to major airlines.  The departure airport is closer to home and the arrival airport was closer to where I wanted to be.  They do nickel and dime you over…"
54,2,Inept ,"First time flying with them. Terrible experience all around. Gate service was poor/inept, take your pick. Announced gate change as they started boarding at the new gate. Just overall poor. Won’t be using them again. They are way overpriced for what they offer."
55,2,Uncomfortable seats,"The new seats in the air plane were absurdly uncomfortable.  They have smashed you in like sardines, zero leg room, and almost no cushion on the sets.  2.5 hr flight and my rear end was numb when we landed on both flights.

58,1,Awful,"This airline assigned pilots to our flight who were not legally allowed to fly the airplane, but didn’t realize this until the plane was taxiing towards the runway. Now we are stuck on the plane on the runway with no pilots to fly the plane."

We backed away from the gate considerably late.  got 50 feet away and they had to shut the left engine down.  Sparks I heard.  After having the fire department come, a mechanic and ordering a part, they finally cancelled the flight.  I was actually glad they did.  I…"
61,1,Very questionable service read before purchase.,Booked a round trip. Missed departing flight. Cancelled return. They said I couldn’t get return funds because I didn’t cancel more than seven days. I did within four.
62,4,"No frills, no hassle, no problems","We were delayed, leaving Allentown due to a mechanical issue issue that required a substitute plane and subsequent burning of excess fuel.
